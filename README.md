# Mapping Indian Boarding Schools and 
Map of Boarding Schools and Murders 




Credit must be given to Archives & Special Collections Waidner-Spahr Library at Dickinson College who began the work of mapping Indian Boarding Schools with [this!](http://users.dickinson.edu/~rose/CISMapRenumbered.html) map. We hope to build and expand on their work.
